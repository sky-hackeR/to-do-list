# to-do-list
This is a practice work on HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web-based to-do list.

A to-do list is a task management tool that helps individuals organize, prioritize, and track their tasks. Users create a list of tasks, assign and mark tasks as completed. This To-do list provides flexibility for reordering tasks. 

The primary goal is to enhance organization.

It can only be accessed via a computer for now as it will be updated in the near future to be responsive across all device types.
